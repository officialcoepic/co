Did you ever wish there was an easier way to write? 
  My Grandfather, Edward J. Cox, wrote a memoir in his 80's with professional help. Millions of Baby Boomers are ready to tell their life stories. They need access to ebook creation, voice to text technology and tools that make writing easy. Coepic.com will be an online writing group focussing on biographies.
	The need to tell stories is as old as time, and writing a biography is a powerful life experience. Why not make it a social one online, based around writing a book one chapter at a time? Publishing should be easy, but the complexity of editing, formatting and publishing even an ebook are beyond most people. A network of writing groups with authors, English teachers, senior citizens and their families will benefit immensely from each other while creating content.
Launching Soon
	Coepic.com is currently a sign up page. It's an idea with an Engineering Manager, Tom Cox, and Electrical Engineer, Dhamodaran Subramian, working together to create the ever-improving web platform. We organized at a Startup Weekend, plan to incorporate and gained business advisors. 
	We've been meeting in a library, but will soon need to hire freelance web developers, interns and pay for a low-rent Silicon Valley address. That's where we need help.
Get This
	Support us and you'll gain a 3-month Author subscription on Coepic.com. Really show your support and you can get publicity, a voice recorder or a meeting with the CEO! See our Perks for all the details. If you can't donate, don't worry: you can still use the website without any features at coepic.com.
Philosophy
	The biggest companies in the Information Age give people access to the world of information and enable communication. What we're attempting is an infusion of not knowledge, but wisdom. People's lives are full of excellent stories and perspectives that aren't now important enough to preserve. For wisdom to get communicated, writing needs to improve on a basic level. Imagine not only learning from parents ang grandparents, but from billions of people producing easily-edited content online.
Call to Action
	If you've ever emailed a friend to have them write something better, then you've needed a writing group. If you've ever handed in an assignment with terrible sentences, then you've needed a writing group. If you've submitted a business report with only machine spellchecking, then you've needed a writing group. There are hundereds of examples, but current online writing groups simply aren't easy to use. So we're creating one so useful it will let you rewrite like a professional and even create an ebook. Sign up at Signup.coepic.com and invite your friends. If you're well-versed, you'll have incentive to edit with Set Your Price.
